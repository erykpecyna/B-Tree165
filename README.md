# s165-A1
Harvard CS s165 Summer School A1 Assignment Starter Code

In the base directory of the starter code, you must first run `make` which compiles the `main` binary target. 
This turns main.c and connected C files, into a native binary that is executable. 

This executable is the embedded database program you will run via the following command:
`./main -f workload-gen/WORKLOAD_FILE.txt`.
This command runs the database program with the workload file specified by `workload-gen/WORKLOAD_FILE.txt` (a .txt file generated by the s165 workload generator contained in `workload-gen/` directory.
